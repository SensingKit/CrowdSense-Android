# CrowdSense-Android

CrowdSense is a free continuous sensing tool, based on the open source library [SensingKit](http://www.sensingkit.org). It provides an easy way for researchers to capture sensor data using any Android device. Taking user privacy seriously, all data are fully anonymised. You can access all sensed data in your Android device's External Storage Directory under the folder "CrowdSense".

It is available for free on the [Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.sensingkit.crowdsensing_android).
